This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP programming: unexpected behavior resulting from implicit type coercion.  The `bug.php` file contains code that exhibits this issue. The `bugSolution.php` file shows how to resolve this issue by explicitly casting variables to the correct type before comparison or using the strict comparison operator (`===`).  Understanding type coercion in PHP is crucial for writing robust and reliable code.
